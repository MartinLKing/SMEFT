Experiments in particle physics have hitherto failed to produce any significant evidence in
searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that are based on the predictions of explicit models. 
As a result, physicists have increasingly turned to model-independent strategies as tools for parametrising a wide range of possible BSM effects. Most popular among them is the Standard Model effective field theory (SM-EFT). In this paper, we describe three stages of this bottom-up EFT and analyse it in the context of the philosophical discussions about models, theories, and effective field theories. We find that while the SM-EFT is a quantum field theory that shares many features with both models and theories, in its general form it lacks some of the important characteristic features of models when it comes to representation. This case study also provides interesting lessons concerning the role of representation in models of new physics and the lower bounds for what should be considered a model in physics.

\section{Introduction}

Since the 2012 discovery of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has produced no significant evidence in favour of the many models beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that have been previously proposed. 
The data gathered since has increasingly reduced the parameter space in which these existing models dwell, while not indicating along which lines new models should be developed.
This has led to an increase in use of simplified models and more model-independent approaches, such as the Standard Model effective field theory (SM-EFT). 
In this paper, we examine some of the philosophical implications of this turn towards model-independence, which will, as a contribution to the general debates about models in science, allow us to study the lower boundary of the concept of model. 
We want to ask: what is the research strategy SM-EFT, what is model-independent about it, and how should we understand it in the context of the philosophical literature on models and effective field theories?

SM-EFT is not the only research strategy in particle physics emerging after the failure to find evidence for any of the concrete BSM models that theoreticians had developed over decades. 
Simplified models that only specify some properties of BSM physics, have already attracted philosophical attention. 
\citet{mccoymassimi} have recently examined their nature and found that they could be understood as models in a suitable extension of practice-based the models as mediators (MaM) approach \citep{morganmorrison}.
This prompts the question whether the same treatment extends to the SM-EFT. 
We find however, that it does not apply as their representative capacities and their relations to theory and data are quite distinct. 

An EFT organizes phenomena under an efficient set of principles and is not too complex to allow one to effectively make predictions. 
But it is manifestly incomplete and restricted to a certain energy range. 
It shares this property with models. 
But as \citet{hartmann2001} has shown they also exhibit features that are typical for theories. 
This raises the question to what extent SM-EFT exhibits features of theories and models.
Hartmann and others mostly focus on what are called \textit{top-down} EFTs, but the SM-EFT is part of a \textit{bottom-up} strategy.
Top-down EFTs provide an effective description of low-energy physics within the context of a more fundamental theory, while bottom-up EFTs are parts of attempts to find such theories. 
We find that the answers to the questions we ask differ depending on the stage of the bottom-up strategy.

In order to undertake this analysis and to answer our guiding questions, we must lay some groundwork distinguishing the methods of searching for new physics and the variety of views on models and EFTs in the philosophical literature. 
In Section~\ref{sec:data} we provide empirical data indicating the increasing popularity of model-independent approaches. 
In Section~\ref{sec:eftintro} we introduce three kinds of approaches presently applied by particle physicists in the search for new physics: full BSM models, simplified models, and SM-EFT. 
Section~\ref{sec:models} provides the relevant background from the contemporary philosophical debates about models and effective field theories. 
Section~\ref{sec:classification} presents the model-independent strategy for finding new physics using the bottom-up approach of the SM-EFT, which we subdivide into three stages.
We show this strategy in action with a case study of b-physics in Section~\ref{sec:BphysicsConcepts}. 
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:analysis} provides a philosophical analysis of the SM-EFT strategy.  
In particular, we distil three lessons that concern: i) the relation that SM-EFT bears to models and theories in semantic \citep{hartmann1998} and practice-based approaches \citep{morganmorrison}; ii) the role of representation in models of new physics; and iii) the lower bounds for what should be considered a model in physics.
